# **Excel – Warehouse Inventory Database Schema**

This Excel file represents a structured warehouse database schema designed to track products, suppliers, customer orders, sales activity, and overall inventory availability. It functions as a simplified inventory-management model that shows how alcoholic beverages move through the supply chain, from supplier to customer, and how stock levels change over time.

The spreadsheet contains several tabs, each representing a key table in the warehouse database:

### **Products**

Contains detailed information on all alcoholic beverages and related items. Includes fields such as product name, barcode, category( water, soda, beer, juice,wine, cider) alcohol percentage, volume, units. This tab defines the core product catalog used throughout the rest of the database.

### **Entries**

Represents incoming stock entries. These records show which products entered the warehouse, in what quantity, supplier name and on which date and buy price. This tab supports tracking restocking activity and supply flow.

### **Suppliers**

Lists all suppliers who provide the alcoholic beverages. Includes supplier names, locations, contact details, and other relevant information. This establishes the source of all incoming products and links to supply records.

### **Customers**

Contains customer information, including names, contact details. This supports tracking who purchases products from the warehouse.

### **Sales**

Documents all sales transactions. Includes the product sold, quantity, customer, date of sale, unit price, and total payment. This tab allows analysis of sales performance and revenue.

### **Goods Availability**

Tracks real-time inventory levels. Shows the remaining quantity for each product based on incoming entries and outgoing sales. This sheet provides a snapshot of which items are in stock and which may require replenishment.

### **Transactions**

Provides a consolidated view of product movement. This includes both supply-side entries and customer-side sales. It shows how products flow into and out of the warehouse, forming the basis of the inventory tracking system.
