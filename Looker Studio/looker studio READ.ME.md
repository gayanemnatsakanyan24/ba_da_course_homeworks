### **Credit Utilization Rate**

A metric that shows how effectively customers use the credit extended to them. This helps assess financial risk and customer payment behavior.

### **Top-Performing Products**

A ranking or chart that highlights the products generating the highest revenue or profit. This allows quick identification of best-selling items and supports strategic decision-making such as inventory adjustments or promotional focus.
